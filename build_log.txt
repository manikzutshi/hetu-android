FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not determine the dependencies of task 
':app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'.
> Could not resolve all task dependencies for 
configuration ':app:debugCompileClasspath'.
   > Could not resolve project :smollm.
     Required by:
         project :app
      > No matching configuration of project :smollm 
was found. The consumer was configured to find a 
library for use during compile-time, preferably 
optimized for Android, as well as attribute 
'com.android.build.api.attributes.BuildTypeAttr' with 
value 'debug', attribute 
'com.android.build.api.attributes.AgpVersionAttr' with 
value '8.2.2', attribute 
'org.jetbrains.kotlin.platform.type' with value 
'androidJvm' but:
          - None of the consumable configurations have 
attributes.

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.

For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.5/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings in the Gradle documentation.
